However, he gave up combat sports and played soccer for two years after his family moved to a different town. Makhachev engaged in constant street fights as a child due to the culture of the region; it is common for adults (such as his coach Magomedov) to pick boys to face each other or for the boys to confront each other. He trained in freestyle wrestling for a year but switched to mixed martial arts under Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov after learning that Khabib was already a professional. Makhachev had been a UFC fan since childhood, his favorite fighters were Tank Abbott and Ken Shamrock. While training, he attended Dagestan State University to study physical education and sports.
